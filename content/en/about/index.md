Kawasaki KLX250/KLX300 is a mature platform with long history dating early 1990s. It has great aftermarket support and a lot of recipes of the performance modifications. However it could be challenging to distill all the information available and figure out what could be applied to a latest EFI generation. It took us a while to find proven recipes for motorcycle tuning and we decided to share it with community. Articles at this website are based on the personal experinece upgrading KLX and making it a better bike (focusing on off-road riding).
Enjoy!
