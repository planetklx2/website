## Upgrading shock spring

Stock shock spring which is 5.6 kg/mm is too soft even for 70kg rider. You can use [RaceTech product search](https://racetech.com/product-search/) to learn about recommended spring rate for your weight and style of riding. Once you know it you can buy spring on ebay at a fraction of the RaceTech cost! See full instruction in the video below:
