## Upgrading springs

Many owners are aware that stock springs are way too soft for riders heavier than 70kg. Standard springs have rate of 0.36 kg/mm. RaceTech recommends about 0.48 kg/mm for a 90kg (200 lb) rider (which is my weight). In this video I demonstrate how to install a single spring from Yamaha Tenere 700 `BW3-23141-00` (keeping remaining spring standard) to get desired 0.48 kg/mm rate. 

Cost of this upgrade is less than $30!
