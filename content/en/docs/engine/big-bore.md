## AHL "299" kit

The most cost efficient option to upgrade KLX250 to KLX300 is AHL "299" kit which is very similar to OEM 292cc kit. Kit consists of everything needed for upgrade:
- cylinder
- piston 78mm
- piston pin
- piston rings
- piston circlips
- gaskets

Piston weights:

- OEM 72mm piston (249cc cylinder) is 235.5g (including pin and piston rings)
- AHL 78mm piston (292cc cylinder) is 272.7g (including pin and piston rings)

And the best part is that in most of the countries you can get it under $200 and sometimes even under $100. For the entire kit! Here is a video review:
