## Subthrottle

The electronically controlled secondary throttle plate,
 as mentioned in the [ECU](./ecu/) section, is one of the first restrictions on engine performance. Fortunately, removing it's quite simple.

### Removal Process

1. Access the throttle body. This may require removing some bodywork for better clearance.
1. Using a JIS screwdriver, remove the screws holding the secondary throttle plate in place.
1. Many instructional videos can be found on YouTube for visual guidance.

A lesser-known fact is that the ECU might control idle speed with a small rocker arm connected to the throttle plate.
This mechanism is somehow linked to sub-throttle control. Removing the sub-throttle plate can often lead to unstable idle.
 
**Recommendation** If you remove the sub-throttle plate, it's recommended to also remove the spring inside the throttle body. This will help prevent high or erratic idle RPM.

### Performance Gains

Removing the sub-throttle plate alone can offer a noticeable improvement in throttle response and a power increase of around 4hp in the midrange on a KLX300 (see dyno chart below). This modification will also benefit a KLX250.

## Airbox & Snorkel

The next significant restriction on airflow is the airbox opening, also known as the snorkel. The stock snorkel has a limited cross-sectional area. Here are two main options for increasing airbox airflow:

### KDX Snorkel

The most popular option is the "KDX snorkel" (OEM part number`14073-1577`) from a Kawasaki KDX220 2-stroke dirt bike.
Its popularity stems from its bolt-on compatibility and doubled airflow capacity compared to the stock KLX snorkel. Importantly, it doesn't create excessive intake noise ("roaring").

Benefits: 
- Noticeable (but not dramatic) power increase in the midrange RPM range (see dyno chart below).
- Easy bolt-on installation.
- No additional noise compared to open airbox ("roaring")

**Please also notice that air-fuel ratio changed from ~13:1 to 14:1.**

{{< alert type="warning" color="warning" title="Warning!" >}}
The dyno chart above shows a KLX250 with the 
sub-throttle plate still in place. Replacing the snorkel with a KDX unit and removing the sub-throttle plate will lean out the air-fuel mixture significantly (potentially reaching 16:1) and can lead to detonation and engine damage. These modifications should not be done together without proper fuel adjustments with piggyback.

### Removing airbox cover

Many riders believe that replacing the snorkel with a KDX unit provides sufficient airflow, and removing the airbox cover won't offer any additional benefit. However, dyno results (at least for bikes with performance exhaust) suggest otherwise.

- The blue line (25 hp) represents the KDX snorkel with a modified stock exhaust (end tip replaced with a larger 25mm pipe).
- The red line (26.5 hp) represents the KDX snorkel with a full performance exhaust (header, midpipe, and muffler).
- The pink and green lines (28.5 hp) represent an open airbox ("lidless") with a performance exhaust.

As you can see **open airbox provide +2hp and +2-3Nm of torque across all RPM range**! The disadvantage of open airbox is that it significantly increase intake noise ("roaring" sound).

### Planetklx2 custom 3D-printed snorkel

We've developed and tested a custom airbox lid with the integrated snorkel. It **available for purchase on eBay [here](https://www.ebay.com/itm/335809113951?mkcid=16&mkevt=1&mkrid=711-127632-2357-0&ssspo=8avnx8xztoo&sssrc=2524149&ssuid=8avnx8xztoo&widget_ver=artemis&media=COPY)**.

The lid provides even better airflow than an open airbox (see detailes in the [review below](./intake/#ultimate-intake-and-snorkel-review-part-2)):

- **Adds 2.5hp and 2-3Nm of torque over standard snorkel**

- **Adds 2hp and 2-2.5Nm of torque over KDX snorkel**
