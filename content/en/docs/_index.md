This guide covers modifications to improve the performance,

 especially off-road performance, of the modern fuel-injected (EFI) Kawasaki KLX250 (2008+) and KLX300 (2021+). While the focus is on dual-sport versions, most of the advice can be applied to SuperMoto (D-Tracker) versions.

One goal of this guide is to show you how to improve your bike with minimal or even no cost. Want to:

- Set up suspension for your weight for under $60? (front and rear!)
- Build a reliable 30+ hp machine on a budget?

Please read on and contribute!

{{< alert title="Note:" >}}
You might be surprised, but the EFI KLX250 and KLX300 are nearly identical bikes. The only differences are engine displacement (249cc for the KLX250, 292cc for the KLX300) and ECU settings.

The trail version,
KLX300R, is already significantly more capable off-road: itâ€™s lighter, has more suspension travel, and is more powerful than its street-legal counterparts. The engine, fuel injection system, and suspension differ from the street-legal models. The KLX300R is currently outside the scope of this guide.
